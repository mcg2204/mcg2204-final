1006 Final

Hi! Attached is my final project for 1006. 

In templates, I have the .html files for each of my pages, index (which is the homepage), classes (which lists all the classes I have taken), and Neptune (which talks about my research). 

In static, I have the images I used, which consist of the an image of me for the homepage and an image of Neptune for my research page. 

Thank you so much, and I hope you have a great semester!
